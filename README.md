Privacy-first, self-evolving multi-agent AI framework for real-time enterprise cybersecurity. Detects threats via graph neural networks, auto-responds intelligently, and hardens against quantum attacks — all while preserving data privacy via federated learning.

**Not another chatbot.** This is production-grade agentic security for banks, healthcare, governments.
